// The concepts of prototypes and prototypal inheritance in ES5 are hard to understand for 
// many developers transitioning from another programming language to JavaScript.

// For this reason, some people applaud classes, as it makes JavaScript appear more familiar to them. 
// Others seem to have launched a holy war against classes, claiming that the class syntax is flawed.
