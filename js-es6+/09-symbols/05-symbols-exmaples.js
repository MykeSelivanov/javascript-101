// What are the pros and cons of using an underscore prefix for expressing our intention that a field is private?
let mySquare = {
    _width: 5,
    getWidth() { return this._width; }
}
// Pros:
// - Notation and developer experience is simple, provided that your team spreads this practice
// - It does not result in a hard-to-read code structure, all you need is one more character

// Cons:
// - The properties are not private in practice, they are just denoted as private, which opens up a possibility 
// of hacking quick and dirty solutions
// - Unlike symbols, there is no clear separation between public and private properties. Private properties appear 
// in the public interface of an object and they are enumerated in forâ€¦of loops, using the spread operator, and Object.keys

// Simulate truly private fields in JavaScript
function F() {
    let privateProperty = 'b';
    this.publicProperty = 'a';
}

let f = new F();
console.log(f.publicProperty);  // returns 'a'
console.log(f.privateProperty); // returns undefined

// In order to use the same idea for classes, we have to place the method definitions that use private properties 
// in the constructor method in a scope where the private properties are accessible. We will use Object.assign 
// to accomplish this goal. 
class C {
    constructor() {
        let privateProperty = 'a';
        Object.assign(this,
            {
                logPrivateProperty() {
                    console.log(privateProperty);
                }
            });
    }
}

let c = new C();
c.logPrivateProperty();

// The field privateProperty is not accessible in the c object. The solution also works when we extend the C class.
class D extends C {
    constructor() {
        super();
        console.log('Constructor of D');
    }
}

let d = new D()
d.logPrivateProperty()
