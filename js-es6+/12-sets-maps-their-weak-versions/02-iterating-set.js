// Sometimes we have to traverse all the elements of a set. This can be done in multiple ways:
// - forEach method,
// - for...of loop,
// - transforming a set into an array by using the spread operator

// As Set is an ordered list, iteration is performed in the order of adding the elements.

let moreColors = new Set(['red', 'blue', 'red', 'orange']);
console.log('forEach function:')
moreColors.forEach(value => { console.log(value) });
//> red
//> blue

console.log('\nfor...of loop:')
for (let value of moreColors) {
    console.log(value);
}
//> red
//> blue

console.log('\nspread operator:')
console.log([...moreColors]);
//> ["red", "blue"]

// Technically, the function argument of the forEach method accepts up to three parameters:
moreColors.forEach( console.log );

// As console.log accepts a variable number of arguments, it prints all the arguments the iteration provides. These are:
// - the upcoming value stored in the set,
// - the belonging key,
// - a reference to the set itself.
// The second and the third arguments are not too useful. Keys and values are pairwise equal in sets. 
// Therefore, the first two arguments are always equivalent in sets. The reason why a key was provided in forEach 
// is compatibility with maps. We may need the third argument in case we donâ€™t have a reference to the set.
