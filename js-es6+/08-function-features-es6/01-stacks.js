// There are two types of memory available to you: the stack and the heap. 
// The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation, while the stack is used for static memory allocation. 
// Accessing the stack is very fast, but the size of the stack is fixed.

// A stack frame is created for the global scope. Then, for each function call, another stack frame is added to the top. 
// These frames stack on top of each other.

// When executing JavaScript code, you get a stack with limited size to work with.
